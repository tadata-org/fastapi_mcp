## Server metadata

You can define the MCP server name and description by modifying:

```python {8-9}
from fastapi import FastAPI
from fastapi_mcp import FastApiMCP

app = FastAPI()

mcp = FastApiMCP(
    app,
    name="My API MCP",
    description="Very cool MCP server",
)
mcp.mount_http()
```

## Tool and schema descriptions

When creating the MCP server you can include all possible response schemas in tool descriptions by changing the flag `describe_all_responses`, or include full JSON schema in tool descriptions by changing `describe_full_response_schema`:

```python {10-11}
from fastapi import FastAPI
from fastapi_mcp import FastApiMCP

app = FastAPI()

mcp = FastApiMCP(
    app,
    name="My API MCP",
    description="Very cool MCP server",
    describe_all_responses=True,
    describe_full_response_schema=True
)

mcp.mount_http()
```

## Customizing Exposed Endpoints

You can control which FastAPI endpoints are exposed as MCP tools using Open API operation IDs or tags to:

- Only include specific operations
- Exclude specific operations
- Only include operations with specific tags
- Exclude operations with specific tags
- Combine operation IDs and tags

### Code samples

The relevant arguments for these configurations are `include_operations`, `exclude_operations`, `include_tags`, `exclude_tags` and can be used as follows:

<CodeGroup>
    ```python Include Operations {8}
    from fastapi import FastAPI
    from fastapi_mcp import FastApiMCP

    app = FastAPI()

    mcp = FastApiMCP(
        app,
        include_operations=["get_user", "create_user"]
    )
    mcp.mount_http()
    ```

    ```python Exclude Operations {8}
    from fastapi import FastAPI
    from fastapi_mcp import FastApiMCP

    app = FastAPI()

    mcp = FastApiMCP(
        app,
        exclude_operations=["delete_user"]
    )
    mcp.mount_http()
    ```

    ```python Include Tags {8}
    from fastapi import FastAPI
    from fastapi_mcp import FastApiMCP

    app = FastAPI()

    mcp = FastApiMCP(
        app,
        include_tags=["users", "public"]
    )
    mcp.mount_http()
    ```

    ```python Exclude Tags {8}
    from fastapi import FastAPI
    from fastapi_mcp import FastApiMCP

    app = FastAPI()

    mcp = FastApiMCP(
        app,
        exclude_tags=["admin", "internal"]
    )
    mcp.mount_http()
    ```

    ```python Combined (include mode) {8-9}
    from fastapi import FastAPI
    from fastapi_mcp import FastApiMCP

    app = FastAPI()

    mcp = FastApiMCP(
        app,
        include_operations=["user_login"],
        include_tags=["public"]
    )
    mcp.mount_http()
    ```

</CodeGroup>

### Notes on filtering

- You cannot use both `include_operations` and `exclude_operations` at the same time
- You cannot use both `include_tags` and `exclude_tags` at the same time
- You can combine operation filtering with tag filtering (e.g., use `include_operations` with `include_tags`)
- When combining filters, a greedy approach will be taken. Endpoints matching either criteria will be included

## Forwarding HTTP headers

By default the MCP server will forward the `Authorization` header from an incoming MCP request to the underlying FastAPI endpoint when invoking tools. You can customize the list of forwarded headers when creating `FastApiMCP` by passing the `headers` parameter (a list of header names). The comparison is case-insensitive.

Example â€” forward a custom `X-API-Key` header in addition to `Authorization`:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from fastapi_mcp import FastApiMCP

app = FastAPI()

mcp = FastApiMCP(
    app,
    name="My API MCP",
    description="Very cool MCP server",
    headers=["authorization", "x-api-key"],  # add any header names you want forwarded
)

mcp.mount_http()
```

Notes:

- Header names are normalized to lower-case internally, so provide regular header names (for example `X-API-Key` or `x-api-key`).
- Only headers present on the incoming MCP request will be forwarded. If you use custom transports or proxies, ensure the header arrives at the MCP endpoint.
- Be careful forwarding sensitive headers. Only include headers that are intended to be proxied to the underlying API endpoints.
