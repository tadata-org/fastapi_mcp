MCP (Model Context Protocol) is the emerging standard to define how AI agents communicate with applications. Using FastAPI-MCP, creating a secured  MCP server to your application takes only 3 lines of code:

```python {2, 6, 7}
from fastapi import FastAPI
from fastapi_mcp import FastApiMCP

app = FastAPI()

mcp = FastApiMCP(app)
mcp.mount()
```
That's it! Your auto-generated MCP server is now available at `https://app.base.url/mcp`

## Features

- [**Authentication**](/advanced/auth) built in, using your existing FastAPI dependencies!

- **FastAPI-native:** Not just another OpenAPI -> MCP converter

- **Zero configuration** required - just point it at your FastAPI app and it works

- **Preserving schemas** of your request models and response models

- **Preserve documentation** of all your endpoints, just as it is in Swagger

- [**Flexible deployment**](/advanced/deploy) - Mount your MCP server to the same app, or deploy separately

- [**ASGI transport**](/advanced/transport) - Uses FastAPI's ASGI interface directly for efficient communication
